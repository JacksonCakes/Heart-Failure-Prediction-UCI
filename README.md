# Introduction
Heart failure is a medical condition where the heart muscle is having difficulty to pump the blood to
circulate around the body. This is a medical condition that has a higher chance of threatening the lives of
patients if left untreated. One of the major concerns on heart failure conditions that are developed over
time is that it is a chronic condition that does not have any cure. It can only be improved with medication
but will never be recovered. Moreover, the mortality rate of patients having heart failure is high after a
certain follow up period. However, early identification of the condition of a patient having heart failure
can help to improve their condition before worsen or at least higher chances of avoiding sudden death due
to heart failure
